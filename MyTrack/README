Building MyTrack

MyTrack builds with ant
To build it requires dependent projects (libraries) to be built with ant as well:
- ActionbarSherlock
- CardsUI

If dependent build.xml files are missing they can be create with "android update project" (see http://www.androidengineer.com/2010/06/using-ant-to-automate-building-android.html for more info)
